# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created a webpage to store the information I learned while completing the prework. A webpage was chosen to be the format in which the information would be stored and displayed because it is a visually appealing and concise platform to organize the information. The webpage was created to serve as a study guide for new coding bootcamp students as it can be very overwhelming to learn and sort through so much material. In order to create the webpage, the three foundational programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used, also tools such as the CLI terminal and GitHub. In creating the webpage for the prework study guide I learned how to effectively use so many different resources and just how important attention to detail is for web developers in their careers.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used by reading each section to gain a greater understanding on the three foundational programming languages and how they are used to write, debug, and execute source code. There is also information on how to use developer resources such as GitHub and the CLI terminal. Under each section there are notes that would give each new student insight on the intentional and detailed process to release a working product.
